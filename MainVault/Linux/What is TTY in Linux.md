What is tty in Linux?

**Bing**
In Linux, tty stands for **teletypewriter** and is a command that prints the name of the terminal you're using. It is a legacy name used to refer to the user interface for text-based input and output, otherwise known as a "terminal". The tty command is a powerful tool for working with virtual consoles in a Linux environment. It allows you to switch between terminals, check whether a script is being run in an interactive shell, and send signals to processes running on a terminal. Is there anything else you would like to know?

it's basically the interactive terminal where I type commands?

**Bing**
Yes, that's correct! The tty command prints the name of the terminal connected to standard input, which is the terminal where you type commands.
