The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) is an independent constitutional body in the Philippines that is responsible for administering all national and local elections in the country². It is composed of a chairman and six commissioners who are natural-born citizens of the Philippines, at least 35 years old, and holders of a college degree². The commission proper is the policy-making body of the COMELEC². 

The COMELEC has created an online platform called **Precinct Finder** that allows voters to verify their precinct number or check their voter registration status¹⁴. You can access the Precinct Finder website by clicking on this link: [Precinct Finder Version 1.0.10.1](^1^).

I hope this helps!
