[The **Sangguniang Kabataan (SK)**, which translates to 'youth council', is a regional council that represents youth in a barangay in the Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangguniang_Kabataan)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangguniang_Kabataan). [It was created through the Local Government Code of 1991 (Republic Act 7160) and provides an opportunity for young people to directly participate in local governance](https://nyc.gov.ph/sangguniangkabataan/)[2](https://nyc.gov.ph/sangguniangkabataan/). [The SK is composed of a chairperson, seven members, a secretary, and a treasurer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangguniang_Kabataan)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangguniang_Kabataan). [The chairperson automatically sits on the barangay council as an ex officio member and is automatically chairman of the Committee on Youth and Sports, one of the standing committees of the barangay council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangguniang_Kabataan)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangguniang_Kabataan).

[The SK is a big deal because it embodies the youth's participation in nation-building](https://www.pna.gov.ph/opinion/pieces/776-a-look-at-the-barangay-and-sk-elections-in-the-philippines)[3](https://www.pna.gov.ph/opinion/pieces/776-a-look-at-the-barangay-and-sk-elections-in-the-philippines). [This is unique to the Philippines as it empowers the youth through electoral exercise to choose their leaders and represent them in the barangay and municipal/city councils](https://www.pna.gov.ph/opinion/pieces/776-a-look-at-the-barangay-and-sk-elections-in-the-philippines)[3](https://www.pna.gov.ph/opinion/pieces/776-a-look-at-the-barangay-and-sk-elections-in-the-philippines). [The council represents youth who have resided in their barangay for at least one year and are registered to vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangguniang_Kabataan)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangguniang_Kabataan). [It leads local youth programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangguniang_Kabataan)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangguniang_Kabataan), making it an important platform for fostering leadership skills among young people. [Members of the SK are paid for serving on the council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangguniang_Kabataan)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangguniang_Kabataan), which further incentivizes youth participation.

[In addition to this, under the 2016 reform, a new Local Youth Development Council was formed to support SK programs and comprised representatives from different youth organizations in the community including student councils, church and youth faith groups, youth-serving organizations, and community-based youth groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangguniang_Kabataan)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangguniang_Kabataan). This further enhances the reach and impact of the SK.

Therefore, the SK plays a crucial role in engaging the youth in governance and decision-making processes at the local level, thereby shaping future leaders of the country.

No, the establishment of the Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) is not optional. [The local government code of the Philippines mandates that there shall be a Sangguniang Kabataan in every Barangay](https://thephilippinestoday.com/sangguniang-kabataan/)[1](https://thephilippinestoday.com/sangguniang-kabataan/). [The SK is composed of a chairman, seven members, a secretary, and a treasurer](https://thephilippinestoday.com/sangguniang-kabataan/)[1](https://thephilippinestoday.com/sangguniang-kabataan/). [This structure is designed to ensure that the youth have representation and can participate in local governance](https://thephilippinestoday.com/sangguniang-kabataan/)[1](https://thephilippinestoday.com/sangguniang-kabataan/).

Yes, participation in the Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) elections, including voting, is optional. [It is not mandatory for eligible voters to participate in these elections](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2023/9/30/Barangay-and-Sangguniang-Kabataan-elections.html)[1](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2023/9/30/Barangay-and-Sangguniang-Kabataan-elections.html)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Philippine_barangay_and_Sangguniang_Kabataan_elections). [However, the SK elections provide a unique opportunity for young Filipinos to shape their local communities and contribute to the nation's development](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2023/9/30/Barangay-and-Sangguniang-Kabataan-elections.html)[3](https://pia.gov.ph/features/2023/06/28/barangay-sk-elections-cornerstone-of-grassroots-governance). Therefore, while it is not compulsory, it is highly encouraged for the youth to participate in these elections.

The **Sangguniang Kabataan (SK)**, or 'youth council', serves several key purposes in the Philippines:
