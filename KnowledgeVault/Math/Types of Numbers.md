- Rationale Numbers - Are fractions and expressed in form of p/q (numerator p) and (denominator nonzero q)
- Irrational Numbers - Does not form p/q. examples are pi, decimals, square root
- Complex numbers - real and "i" imaginary numbers
- Imaginary Number - a number that is expressed in terms of the square root of a negative number (usually the square root of −1, represented by _i_ or _j_ ).
